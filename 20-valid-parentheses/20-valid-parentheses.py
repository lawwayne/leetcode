# The Time Complexity is O(n) as for any given string we are taking a linear search approach. 
# The Space Complexity is also O(n) as the stack does take a bit of memory and it is necessary in order to keep track of each parentheses value.
# For the lower bound it would be Î©(1) and that is only if the string itself would be empty.
